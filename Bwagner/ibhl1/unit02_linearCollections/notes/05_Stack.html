<h1>Linear Collection: Stack</h1>
      <p><strong>Stacks</strong> are linear collections in which access is completely restricted 
        to just one end, called the <strong>top</strong>. The classical example 
        is the stack of clean trays found in every cafeteria. Whenever a tray 
        is needed, it is removed from the top of the stack, and whenever clean 
        ones come back from the scullery, they are again placed on the top. No 
        one ever takes some particular fine tray from the middle of the stack, 
        and it is even possible that trays near the bottom are never used. Stacks 
        are said to adhere to a last-in, first-out protocol <strong>(LIFO)</strong>. 
        The last tray brought back from the scullery is the first one taken by 
        a customer.</p>
      <h3>JCF - Java Collections Framework</h3>
      <p>The java.util package includes a <strong>Stack</strong> class. The methods used 
        to manipulate a stack are shown below. The operations for putting items 
        on and removing items from a stack are called <strong>push</strong> and 
        <strong>pop</strong>, respectively.</p>
		
      <h3>class java.util.Stack&lt;E&gt;</h3>
      <table id="csTable">
        <tr> 
          <td width="40%">E <strong>push</strong>(E item)</td>
          <td width="69%">pushes item onto the top of the 
            stack; returns item</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>E <strong>pop</strong>()</td>
          <td>removes and returns the element at the top 
            of the stack</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>E <strong>peek</strong>()</td>
          <td>returns the element at the top of the stack</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>boolean <strong>isEmpty</strong>()</td>
          <td>throws an exception if the stack is empty</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>* Note: The Stack class provided by the JCF is a subclass of another 
        class called Vector (similar to an ArrayList). An unfortunate side effect 
        of this implementation is that clients can treat stacks as vectors by 
        inserting, replacing, or removing an element at <strong>any</strong> position, 
        thus violating the spirit of a stack which only allows manipulation from 
        the <strong>top</strong>.</p>
		
      <h2>Using a Stack</h2>
      <h3>Creating a Linked List Object</h3>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
Stack&lt;Integer&gt; myStack = new Stack();
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>or</p>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
List&lt;Integer&gt; myStack = new Stack();
        </pre>
      </div>
      <h3>Adding an Object to a Stack</h3>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
myStack.push(57);
        </pre>
      </div>
      <h3>Removing an Object from a Stack</h3>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
int num = myStack.pop();
        </pre>
      </div>
      <h3>Viewing the Top of a Stack</h3>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
int num = myStack.peek();  <font color="#009900">// does not remove the item</font>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <h3>Traversing a Stack</h3>
      <div id="csCode"><pre>
while(!myStack.isEmpty())
{
   System.out.println(myStack.pop());
}
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h1>Applications of Stacks</h1>
      <p>Applications of stacks in computer science are numerous. Following are 
        just a few examples:</p>
      <div id="csTable"><ul>
        <li>Parsing expressions in context-free programming languages - a problem 
          in compiler design</li>
        <li>Translating infix expressions to postfix form and evaluating postfix 
          expressions</li>
        <li>Backtracking algorithms</li>
        <li>Managing computer memory in support of method calls</li>
        <li>Supporting the &quot;undo&quot; feature in text editors, word processors, 
          spreadsheet programs, etc.</li>
        <li>Maintaining a history of the links visited by a Web browswer</li>
      </ul></div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h1>Analyzing the Performance of Stack Implementations</h1>
      <p>The run-time performance of a stack implementation depends on the run-time 
        performance of the operations on the data structure contained in it. Stacks 
        are linear collections, so the natural choices for implementation are 
        based on arrays (ArrayLists) and linked structures (LinkedList).</p>
      <p>A stack that uses an array list or an array can push or pop elements 
        in constant time O(1), with one exception. When the underlying array runs 
        out of room, it must be resized, and this operation takes linear time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, elements can always be added to the end or the beginning 
        of a linked structure in constant time. A linked structure requires three 
        times the memory to represent the links and references to the data but 
        no extra memory to represent the data themselves. Thus, where time is 
        of the essence, a linked implementation is usually preferable.</p>
