<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Write a program that allows a user to enter an unknown number of words. Input should
     stop when the user types the sentinel value "stop". When the input process is complete,
	 the program should display each word in its original form, in all upper case letters, 
	 and in all lower case letters.</p>
  <p>Since you do not know how many words the user will enter you will need to make the
     array's <strong>physical size</strong> large enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of words.
	 You will also need to include a variable that keeps track of the array's <strong>logical size</strong>,
	 that is, the actually number of words that have been entered into the array.</p>
  <p>The String class includes two methods that return strings that have been converted
     into all uppercase and lowercase letters. As an example, the following code</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
String str = "Computer";
System.out.println(str.toUpperCase());
System.out.println(str.toLowerCase());
</pre>
</div>
<p>produce this output</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
COMPUTER
computer
</pre>
</div>

<p>Use <strong>printf</strong> to display the output in columnar format.</p>
