  <h1>Nested Loops</h1>
  <p>When a loop is located inside the body of another loop it is said to be <strong>nested</strong> within another loop. When you "nest" two loops,
     the outer loop takes control of the number of complete repetitions of the inner loop. While all types of loops may be nested,
	 the most commonly nested loops are for loops.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:420px">
<pre>
for(int r = 0; r < 10; r++)      <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// outer loop</pre></div>
{
   for(int c = 0; c < 10; c++)   <div id="csHighlight"><pre>// inner loop</pre></div>
   {
   
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
  <p>We have all seen web page counters that resemble the one shown below. Your car's odometer works in a similar manner.</p>
 
<center> <applet
           code	= "WebCounter.class"
		   archive = "WebCounter.jar"
		   codebase = "applets"
           width	= "210"
           height	= "60">
     </applet></center>

<p>This counter and your car's odometer are little more than seven or eight nested for loops, each going from 0 to 9. The far-right
   number iterates the fastest, visibly moving from 0 to 9 as you drive your car or increasing by one as people visit a web site.
   A for loop which imitates the movement of the far-right number is shown below:</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:420px">
<pre>
for(int ones=0; ones <= 9; ones++)
{
    System.out.println(ones);
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>The far-right number, however, is not the only number that is moving. All of the other numbers are moving also, but at a much slower pace.
   For every 10 numbers that move in the column on the right, the adjacent column is incremented by one. The two nested loops shown below may
   be used to imitate the movement of the two far-right numbers of a web counter or an odometer:</p>
  <img src="images/nested1.gif">
  
 <p>The number of digits in the web page counter or the odometer determine the number of nested loops needed to imitate the process.</p>

<div id="csNote">When working with nested loops, the outer loop changes only after the inner loop is completely finished.</div>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>The applet below demonstrates the flow of <strong>two nested for loops</strong>. Press the Step button to advance to the next statement. Press Reset to start the program over.</p>
<center> <applet
           code	= "Nested.class"
		   archive = "Nested.jar"
		   codebase = "applets"
           width	= "480"
           height	= "320">
     </applet></center>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>A factorial of an integer, n, is the product of all the integers from 1 to n. It is written as n!. For example, <br><br>

5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120<br>
8! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 = 40320<br><br>

   It may seem a little strange
   if you haven't come across it before, but it can be a very useful value. For instance, n! is the number of ways you can arrange
   n different things in sequence, so a deck of cards can be arranged in 52! different sequences. Let's try calculating some factorial values.</p>

<p>The following example will calculate the factorial of every integer 1 up to a given limit.</p>
<div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class Factorial
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      long limit = 20;      
      long factorial = 1;
	  
      // Loop from 1 to the value of limit
      for(int i =1; i <= limit; i++)                  <font color="#FF0000">// outer loop</font>
      {
          factorial = 1;
          for(int factor = 2; factor <= i; factor++)  <font color="#FF0000">//  inner loop</font>
          {
              factorial *= factor;
          }
          System.out.println(i + "!" + " is " + factorial);
      }
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>This program will produces the following output</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
1! is 1
2! is 2
3! is 6
4! is 24
5! is 120
6! is 720
7! is 5040
8! is 40320
9! is 362880
10! is 3628800
11! is 39916800
12! is 479001600
13! is 6227020800
14! is 87178291200
15! is 1307674368000
16! is 20922789888000
17! is 355687428096000
18! is 6402373705728000
19! is 121645100408832000
20! is 2432902008176640000
</pre>
</div>
<P>The outer loop, controlled by i, walks through all the integers from 1 to the value of limit. In each iteration
   of the outer loop, the variable factorial is initialized to 1 and the nested loop calculates the factorial of the
   current value of i using factor as the control counter which runs from 2 to the current value of i. The resulting
   value of factorial is then displayed, before going to the next iteration of the outer loop.</P>
