<h1>What is GitHub</h1>
<p>To understand what GitHub is you first have know what a <strong>Git</strong> is. A <strong>Git</strong> is a version control system to keep track of changes to files and projects over time. If you use a git it will allow you to make changes to a file but still keep previous versions of the file in case you want/need to revert back to one. It works like undo and redo in an editor, but it does it for entire files.</p>
<p>Now what is GitHub? GitHub is a website that hosts Git <strong>repositories</strong> online, allowing software developers to store their programming projects on the cloud with version control(Git). GitHub also makes it  
   easier for developers to share their code with other developers. Founded in 2008, GitHub is by far the largest website of its kind. It is currently owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>This begs the question what is a <strong>repository</strong>? A repository or "repos" are folders which contain snapshots or previous versions of the files in the folder. These repos are intentional made by developers so that when they are working on a project, if they make changes to a file or files in that project they can be uploaded or "committed" to GitHub so that GitHub can track those changes.</p>

<p>That was a brief description of GitHub. However, to be honest, to really understand what GitHub can do you have to create account and use it yourself, so let's make an account.</p>
