<p>In this lesson, we again are using the <strong>AnimatedActor</strong> class to animate Mario's walking movement, but I
   have also given Mario the ability to climb up and down ladders. The sprite sheet for this exercise
   includes frames that can be used to animate Mario's movement up and down the ladders.</p>

<h1>Mario Sprite Sheet</h1>
<p>The mario sprite sheet consists of 16 frames. The frames numbered from 0 to 8 are used for walking and frames 9 to 15 are
   used to animate climbing a ladder.</p>

<h1>Mario Class</h1>
  <p>The Mario class, in this exercise, is similar to the previous one, except that he can no longer jump,
     but instead has the ability to move up and down ladders by using the "up" and "down" arrow keys. 
     This behavior is implemented in the method <strong>climbLadderTest</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>Below is the basic structure of this method.</p>
 <div><img src="greenfoot/images/MarioClimb03.png"></div>  
 <p>If the "up" arrow key is pressed then Mario is going to attempt to ascend the ladder, and if the
    "down" arrow key is pressed he is going to attempt to descend the ladder, and finally if no key has been
    pressed he is just going to stay where he is. I use the word attempt because the "up" and "down"
    arrow keys have no effect on Mario if is not touching a ladder.</p>
 <p>To help you better understand what the <strong>climbLadderTest</strong> is doing I have divided the if-else
    structure into its three sections: Ascending the ladder, Descending the ladder, and not moving.
    Look at the comments that I have written for each line of code this should help you to understand
    the code.</p>

<h1>Program Modifications</h1>

     <p>A <strong>Coin</strong> class has been added to the scenario along with a sprite sheet
      named "coinSheet7x32x32.png" placed in the scenario's image folder. A Coin object can be animated
      so that it looks like it is spinning around on its y-axis.
      
      <p>Notice the naming convention
      that I used for the sprite sheet, specifically, "7x32x32". This tells me that the sprite sheet has
      7 frames and each frame has a width of 32 pixels and a height of 32 pixels. This naming style can
      save you so time since you don't have to calculate or look these value up when creating an
      AnimatedActor.</p>
      
  <ol id="csList">
      <li><p>Create a Coin object in the MyWorld constructor. Use following information when creating the object:
      sprite sheet = "coinSheet7x32x32.png"<br>
      number of frames = 7<br>
      width of a frame = 32<br>
      height of a frame = 32</p>
      <p>Note: The code that animates the coin has already been added to the Coin class's constructor. As long as the coin has been 
         added to the world it will 
         automatically start spinning when the Run button is clicked.</p></li>
      <li>Add the Coin object to the world at the following location: (300, 214).</li>
      <li>Create a method in the Mario class that will test to see if Mario collides with 
          a coin. If he does, the coin should be removed from the world. Hint: use the Actor class method
          <strong>removeTouching</strong> in your implementation.</p></li>
