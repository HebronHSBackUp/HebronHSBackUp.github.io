<p>In this lesson a startup screen is added to the game.</p>

<h1>StartUpScreen Class</h1>
<p>This scenario includes three new classes: <strong>StartUpScreen</strong>, <strong>Title</strong>, and <strong>StartButton</strong>.</p>
 <p>The StartUpScreen class is a subclass of World. When the game is started an object of this class is created and its world 
   appears on the screen. The purpose of this class is to provide a screen with information about the game such as which keys to use or the
   current high score.</p>
<p>Two actors are added to the StartUpScreen class named Title and StartButton. The Title class provides a title graphic
   for the startup screen. The StartButton actor is used as a button that the user clicks on to exit the startup screen and 
   play the game.</p>
   
<h3>Multiple Worlds</h3>
<p>When a scenario contains multiple World subclasses how does it know which one to display first? The answer is you have tell it.
   To notify the scenario of which class should be displayed first do the following: </p>
   <ol id="csList"> 
   <li><p>In our game we want the StartUpScreen world to appear first so you would right-click on it and select <strong>new StartUpScreen()</strong>.
   This process selects StartupScreen as the first world to appear when the scenario is executed.</p>
   
   <div><img src="greenfoot/images/FlappyBird8_01.png"></div>
   
   </li>
   <li><p>The Greenfoot environment remembers which world is the startup world so you only have to do this selection process once.</p></li>
   </ol>
	
	<h1>Program Modifications</h1>
	<p>Add sound to the FlappyBird game. In the FlappyBird8 Scenario folder there is a sound folder that contains three sound files
	   named <strong>flap.wav</strong>, <strong>score.wav</strong>, and <strong>smack.wav</strong>. Use the flap sound when Flappy is
	   flying, use score sound when Flappy passes through a set of pipes, and use smack sound when Flappy collides with a pipe.</p>
	   
	<p>To add sound to the game do the following:</p>
	<ol id="csList">
	<li><p>From the <strong>Help</strong> menu select <strong>Greenfoot Class Documentation.</strong></p></li>
	<li><p>Click on the class <strong>GreenfootSound</strong> to view its API(available methods).</p></li>
	<li><p>In our game we will be using two of the available methods: the GreenfootSound <strong>constructor</strong> and the method <strong>play</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>constructor</strong> creates a GreenfootSound object and assigns it a sound from a file.</p>
	<div id="csCode" style="width:550px"><pre>GreenfootSound flapSound = new GreenfootSound("flap.wav");</pre></div>
	<p><strong>Add</strong> this line of code to the Flappy class in its instance variable section.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>The <strong>play</strong> method plays the sound.</p>
	<div id="csCode" style="width:550px"><pre>flapSound.play();</pre></div>
	<p><strong>Add</strong> this line of code in the Flappy class's act method inside the if statement that tests
	   to see if the "up" arrow key has been pressed.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>Add</strong> the two other sounds to the game with the behavior described above. Use the <strong>score sound</strong> in the FlappyWorld class and use
	       the <strong>smack sound</strong> in the Flappy class.</p></li>

	<h3>Found a Bug</h3>
	<p>As you know, a bug in computer jargon means an error. While doing my final testing 
	   of the finished game I discovered a bug. Flappy has the ability to fly above the
		pipes, not die, and the score continues to update.</p>
	<li><p>Your final task is to correct this bug. Which class do you need to modify? How are you going
	   to prevent Flappy from flying above the pipes?</p></li>
	</ol>
