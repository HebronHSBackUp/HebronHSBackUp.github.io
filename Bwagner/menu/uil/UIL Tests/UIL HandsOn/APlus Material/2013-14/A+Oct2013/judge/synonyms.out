my favorite subject is comp sci the other classes are not 
very fun cs is extremely diverting because i love to solve problems 
and write cool programs which is not vastly hard 
a really difficult class is precalc even though i almost 
enjoy that class too it is challenging to get excited about 
phys ed the second most festive class to me that is also 
especially tricky is physics working tough physics problems 
is enormously demanding grueling and arduous but amusing too
